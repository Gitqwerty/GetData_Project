GetData_Project
===============

This repository contains the required components for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

You will find the files run_analysis.R which contains the script necessary to clean the data. The R script assumes the working directory is it's current directory and the Samsung data is in that directory in zipped format.

Also in this repository is a CodeBook.md which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

Lastly, this repository contains this README.md file.
